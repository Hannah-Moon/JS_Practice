# Daily JS Challenge
Everyday, I am taking a small challenge to refine my coding skills. I get problems from multiple resources and store them in this repository to show my progress. 
I will share all the resources where I got the problems and how I come up with solutions inside of the solution.js file. 

## Challenge
Each problem comes with a description. 

|  # | Description               | Problem                              | Solution                               |
|----|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 01 | [Writing simple function]() | [problem](problem_01.js) | [solution](solution_01.js) |

## Big problem happened!!
As I delved into the depths of my code repository, striving to perfect every line and polish every function, a sudden hiccup disrupted my flow. With a sense of frustration, I realized that GitHub had unexpectedly booted me out, demanding a new password as if I had trespassed into forbidden digital territory.

Undeterred, I complied, crafting a new password with fingers that seemed to dance across the keyboard in a fervent attempt to regain access. Yet, as I eagerly attempted to push my meticulously crafted code once again, an unexpected torrent of errors cascaded onto my screen like a relentless storm.

I found myself drowning in a sea of cryptic error messages, each more confounding than the last. Desperation began to seep in as I scoured countless articles and forums, seeking a lifeline amidst the chaos of my digital plight. But alas, none held the solution to my predicament.

Just as I felt my resolve waning, like a beacon of hope amidst the tempest, my dear classmate El and our esteemed instructor, Bryan, burst into the meeting room. Their mere presence seemed to infuse the stale air with a renewed sense of purpose and determination.

With their expertise and support, they became the indispensable pillars upon which I could lean in my hour of need. El's sharp wit and intuitive understanding of code, coupled with Bryan's sage guidance and wealth of experience, proved to be the dynamic duo capable of untangling even the most perplexing of digital conundrums.

Together, we embarked on a collaborative journey, dissecting each error with surgical precision and methodically troubleshooting every nuance of the code. Through relentless perseverance and a shared commitment to excellence, we navigated through the labyrinth of bugs and glitches that had ensnared my repository.

In the end, it was not just about fixing lines of code or resolving technical glitches; it was a testament to the power of camaraderie and the profound impact of genuine human connection in the face of adversity. As I finally pushed my code with renewed confidence, I couldn't help but feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude for the invaluable support of El and Bryan. Their unwavering dedication not only salvaged my project but also fortified our bond as collaborators and friends.
